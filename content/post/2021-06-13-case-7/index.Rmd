<br><br>
**Microscopy:** <br> Characterized by so called myxoma cell (or lepidic cell), which is frequenly located around vessels.<br>Intratumoural elastic fibres (Gamnaâ€“Gandy bodies). <br> Hemorrhage is common. <br> Extramedullary haematopoiesis in 7%.<br> If calcifications extensive also called lithomyxoma.
