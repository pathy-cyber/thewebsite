<br>

**Definion:** <br>Rare disease characterized by repeated episodes of bleeding into the lungs <br>
<br>
**Epidemiology and clinical features:** <br> Rare; diagnosis of exclusion. <br>80% diagnosed in children, 20% in adults. <br> Proposed risk factors: Genetic predisposition, Environmental exposure, Immunologic association, Allergic reaction. 
<br><br>
**Microscopy:** <br> Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and dense infiltrate of hemosiderophages. <br>Often iron incrustations in vessel wall, which can be highlighted with a Berlin-Blue Reaction (Fe).<br> No focal or diffuse smooth muscle cell proliferations, no vascular malformations, no malignancy, no pulmonary infarcts, no capillaritis/vasculitis, no granulomatous inflammation, and no infectious agents should be present.
<br><br>

**Differential diagnosis (according to Ioachimescu et al.):** <br> Conditions associated with pulmonary vasculitis/capillaritis:<br>

Systemic vasculitides: microscopic polyangiitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, pauci immune glomerulonephritis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, Behcet disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disorder, Churg Strauss syndrome, essential cryoglobulinemia, hypersensitivity vasculitis.<br>

Other conditions: isolated pulmonary pauci-immune capillaritis, Goodpasture's syndrome, IgA nephropathy, antiphospholipid syndrome, autologous/allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant, lung transplant rejection, ulcerative colitis, retinoic acid syndrome, subacute bacterial endocarditis.<br><br>

Conditions not associated with pulmonary vasculitis/capillaritis: <br> coagulopathies, platelet functional defects, thrombocytopenia, diffuse intravascular coagulation, venous thromboembolic disease, pulmonary neoplasia, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, pulmonary infarction, arterio-venous malformation, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, tuberous sclerosis, pulmonary capillary haemangiomatosis, mitral stenosis, diffuse alveolar damage, crack cocaine or trimellitic anhydride inhalation, idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis.

**Prognosis:**<br> Data is limited. Patients usually die either from acute respiratory failure due to acute hemorrhage or chronic respiratory failure due to pulmonary fibrosis.In pediatric patients, the five-year survival has increased to 67–84% at the end of the twentieth century, compared to 2.5–5 years, reported earlier in the literature.Among latest adult cases, 14% of patients died during the acute phase and survival beyond 40 years has been documented (Saha Review 2020)
